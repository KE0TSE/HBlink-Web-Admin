This tool is in ALPHA testing, use at your own risk.

Things to remember:
* ALWAYS make a backup of rules.py and hblink,cfg prior to using the web interface. Once you start using the interface, it will completely change the layout of both files.
* DO NOT run this on a publicly accessable port as there is no user authentication (yet).

# Setup
